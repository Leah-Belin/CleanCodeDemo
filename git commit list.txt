28054b9  Added String Argument
	Uncle Bob also adds an int element, but realizes at this point that 
	the code is unmaintainable.  Each argument type would require some way
	to parse its schema lement in order to select the HashMap for that
	type.  Each argument type needed to be parsed in the command-line strings 
	and converted to its true type.  Finally, each argument type needed
	a getXXX method so that it could be returned to the caller as its true
	type.

This is the start of the ArgumentMarshaler concept
